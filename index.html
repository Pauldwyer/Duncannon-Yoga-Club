            <h2 class="center-our-story">Our Story</h2>
            <p class="center-our-story">Duncannon Yoga Club was founded by Denise Dwyer in 2016 encouraged by her husband to get somewhere of her own after years of teaching in local halls and on the local beach.
                It was her own little private quiet space when she opened and unexpectedly the studio community has been building ever since. It has continued to grow into a local haven where people can come to escape the craziness of their everyday lives. 
                But staying true to her roots she still teaches a class every Sunday morning 9am on the beach

            <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
            <p>Yin Yoga is slow-paced style of yoga as exercise, incorporating principles of traditional Chinese medicine, with asanas (postures) that are held for longer periods of time than in other styles.</p>
            <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
            <p>Hatha yoga can be considered an umbrella term to describe many of the most common forms of yoga taught in the West today. </p>
            <h3>Gentle Yoga / Meditation</h3>
            <p>Gentle yoga is essentially what it sounds likeâ€”a gentler style of hatha yoga practice. It is performed at a slower pace, with less intense positions, and usually includes extended time for meditation, yogic breath work, and relaxation.</p>
